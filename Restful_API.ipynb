        "1. **What is a RESTful API?**  \n",
        "   A RESTful API is an architectural style for building networked applications. It uses stateless communication and standard HTTP methods, allowing clients to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources through defined endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Explain the concept of API specification.**  \n",
        "   An API specification is a comprehensive description of how an API should behave, including its endpoints, request and response formats, authentication methods, and error codes. It serves as a blueprint for developers, ensuring consistent implementation and easier integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?**  \n",
        "   Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is easy to set up and use. Its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive documentation make it a popular choice for developing RESTful APIs quickly, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than boilerplate code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is routing in Flask?**  \n",
        "   Routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URL patterns to specific functions, enabling the application to respond to different requests. By defining routes, developers can control how the application handles various endpoints and the logic associated with each.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **How do you create a simple Flask application?**  \n",
        "   To create a simple Flask application, first import the Flask class and instantiate it. Then, define one or more routes using the `@app.route()` decorator, linking URLs to functions that return responses, such as HTML or JSON data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?**  \n",
        "   Common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs include GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update existing data), DELETE (remove data), and PATCH (partially update data). Each method serves a specific purpose in managing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?**  \n",
        "   The `@app.route()` decorator is used to associate a specific URL pattern with a function in Flask. This enables the application to handle requests to that URL by executing the corresponding function and returning the appropriate response.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?**  \n",
        "   GET requests are used to retrieve data from a server and should not alter the server's state, while POST requests send data to the server to create or update resources. POST requests typically include a request body, whereas GET requests do not.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?**  \n",
        "   Error handling in Flask APIs can be accomplished using custom error handlers that catch exceptions and return specific HTTP status codes and messages. This ensures that clients receive meaningful feedback when an error occurs, such as 404 for not found or 500 for server errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?**  \n",
        "    To connect Flask to a SQL database, you can use an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tool like SQLAlchemy. After setting up the database URI in the Flask app configuration, you can create models and interact with the database using SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?**  \n",
        "    Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that simplifies the integration of SQLAlchemy with Flask applications. It provides a high-level API for database operations, allowing developers to define models, manage sessions, and perform queries with ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?**  \n",
        "    Blueprints in Flask are a way to organize application components into reusable modules. They allow developers to define routes, handlers, and templates independently, promoting better code organization and modular design, especially in larger applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What is the purpose of Flask's request object?**  \n",
        "    The request object in Flask encapsulates all incoming request data, including form data, query parameters, and HTTP headers. It allows developers to access and manipulate request information easily within their route handlers.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?**  \n",
        "    To create a RESTful API endpoint, define a route using the `@app.route()` decorator, specifying the desired HTTP method (e.g., GET or POST). Implement a function that processes the request and returns a response, typically in JSON format.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?**  \n",
        "    The `jsonify()` function converts Python dictionaries or lists into JSON format, suitable for API responses. It also sets the correct content type for the response, making it easier to return structured data to clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **Explain Flask’s url_for() function.**  \n",
        "    The `url_for()` function generates URLs for specific functions based on their names, helping to avoid hardcoding URLs in your application. This allows for dynamic URL creation, making your application more maintainable and easier to navigate.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?**  \n",
        "    Flask serves static files from a folder named \"static\" by default. Developers can access these files directly via URLs, allowing for easy inclusion of stylesheets, scripts, and images in their applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?**  \n",
        "    An API specification provides a detailed outline of the API’s structure, including endpoints, methods, request and response formats, and authentication. This helps developers understand how to interact with the API, ensuring consistency and facilitating easier integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?**  \n",
        "    HTTP status codes indicate the outcome of an API request, informing clients whether the request was successful, resulted in an error, or requires further action (e.g., redirects). Proper use of status codes enhances communication and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **How do you handle POST requests in Flask?**  \n",
        "    To handle POST requests in Flask, define a route with the `@app.route()` decorator and specify `methods=['POST']`. Access the incoming data through `request.form` for form submissions or `request.json` for JSON payloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **How would you secure a Flask API?**  \n",
        "    Securing a Flask API can be achieved through various methods such as implementing authentication (e.g., JWT), using HTTPS for secure communication, and validating inputs to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?**  \n",
        "    Flask-RESTful enhances Flask by providing tools to build REST APIs more efficiently. It includes features like resource routing, input validation, and support for API documentation, making it easier to develop robust APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **What is the role of Flask’s session object?**  \n",
        "    Flask's session object allows developers to store user-specific data across requests, maintaining state in a stateless environment. It enables features like user authentication and preferences to persist between different interactions."
